# Creating-an-enemy-and-a-health-system-inside-of-unity

The first thing that you will need to do to create an enemy character is first go to the hierarchy section and right click and get a empty game object and call it enemy player once you have done that you can then drag and drop you enemy sprite onto the empty game object to make it a child of the empty game object then you will want to click onto the sprite and create a component inside the hierarchy and that component will need to be a capsule collider once you have that you will need to re size it to make it fit your character perfectly once you have done all of that you will now be ok to start creating a script
So once you have created your script you will need to call it player health this way you will have a clear understanding of where your player health is once inside the script you will need to first create some variable that will keep track of your health so the first one you will need to make is a public int maxHealth and equal that to 10; the next variable that you will need to create is a public int health; and this will allow you to see your health in the inspector later. Then you will need to go to the start and inside there you will need to put health = maxHealth; that way when the game starts you will always start on max health.
The next thing you will need to do is go to the bottom of the code and create a new function called public void TakeDamage () {} and what this will do is this function will be called by the enemy when the player makes contact so that the player will be able to take damage, so you will now need to go inside of the brackets and create a variable which will be a integer and call it damage then inside of the curly brackets type health -= damage; so with this code we can now take damage however it won’t kill the player if we get beyond zero, so to do this you will need to create an if statement health <= 0 now before we put anything inside the curly brackets we will need to go back up to the top and create a new variable which is a public int and call it Respawn; now you can go back to the curly brackets put SceneManager.loadscene(Respawn) once you have done that you can then go back to unity and click on your player and drag the new script onto it, one thing you will need to do before you continue is inside the inspector you will find the public variable that we just created now what you will need to do is set the number to the current scene that you would like the player to restart in because if you don’t set it to the right number it won’t work.
Now the next thing we need to do is actually make the enemy deal the damage to the player, so to do this you will need to once again create a new script and call it enemy damage and open it up, once you are inside we will need to create a new variable called public int damage; and the reason that we don’t set the value inside of the code is because when we place the enemy in the game each enemy will be able to deal different amounts of damage.
Now that you have done that we will now need to make it so that this script can talk to our other script that we just made so to do this we create a public PlayerHealth (which is the name of the script) playerHealth. Next you can then delete the start and the update section as we won’t need them, so instead we need to create a private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision) so now we need to make sure that when something collides with this enemy it is actually the player so we will need to create an if statement and inside the brackets put collision.gameObject.tag == “Player” then inside the curly brackets put playerHealth.TakeDamage which is the bit of code that we made inside of the other script, then make some brackets and inside of there put the word damage.
The next thing that you will need to do is go back to unity and put the enemy damage script onto the actual enemy then you will need to pick a value of the amount of damage you want this enemy to actually do to the player then you will need to drag the player from the hierarchy section and drag it into the player health in the inspector to get a reference to where the player health code is.
